In this assignment, we added these following bonus features:

A. Unit tests using GTest - 
We adjusted the tests and from assignment 1 and added some new ones to work with the current API, checking the functionality and correctness of the new algorithm.

To run the tests, after building the program, cd into build/src/tests and run $ ./unit_tests

B. Robot path animation - 
We updated the animation to include the current steps and adjusted the input parsing to match the new input file format.

To run the program, simply run the run.sh script or use "python3 visualize_map.py ../input/input_a.txt" inside the scripts folder to run it.
To see the animation, make sure you have the matplotlib python package installed. (if not, install using 'pip install matplotlib').
If you get an error "UserWarning: Matplotlib is currently using agg...", install tk-inter package using 'sudo apt-get install python3-tk'.

C. UML DIAGRAM - 
We created a UML Class Diagram and a UML Sequence Diagram for the current assignment.
