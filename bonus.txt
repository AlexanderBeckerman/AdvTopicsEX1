In this assignment, we added these following bonus features:

A. Unit tests using GTest - 
Inside the folder tests you will find several tests for different parts of the assignment.
These tests include testing of the basic functionality of the algorithm such as not walking into walls, not staying in charge more than necessary etc.
We also added tests for different functions in our code to test their correctness.

To run the tests, simply build the program and then run unit_tests.

B. Robot path animation - 
Using python, we added a graphical representation of the given input map, and on top of that we animated the steps the robot performed. 
The animation also includes the robot's battery level each step and the dirtiness level of each floor tile.

To run the program, simply run the run.sh script or use "python3 visualize_map.py ../input/input_a.txt" inside the scripts folder to run it.
To see the animation, make sure you have the matplotlib python package installed. (if not, install using 'pip install matplotlib').
If you get an error "UserWarning: Matplotlib is currently using agg...", install tk-inter package using 'sudo apt-get install python3-tk'.

C. Logging to output/logs  -
We added a logging feature to log every move the robot does, into the output/logs folder. 
This includes information such as the real-time it ran, the decision it made each step, battery level each step and the current relative location of the robot.
This includes info, warning and error logs.
